# Object-oriented programming (OOP)

## Explain the concept of object-oriented programming.
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm base on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data, in the form of field (often known as attributes), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). 
A key feature of OOP is that it allows for the organization of code in a way that models real-world entities, improving code reusability and maintainability.

## Explain the concept of encapsulation in object-oriented programming.
Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental principles of OOP.
It involves bundling data and the methods thats oparate on that data within a single unit, or object.
It helps in hiding the internal state of an object from the outside, preventing accidental modification and promoting data integrity.

# Database

## Describe the concept of a database transaction.
A database transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work.
It follows the ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, ensuring that the database remains in a valid state even if errors occur.

## What is the difference between a 'stack' and a 'queue'?
A 'stack' is a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.
A 'queue, on the other hand, is a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure, where the first element added is the first one to be removed.

## What is the role of an operating system?
An operating system acts as a intermediary between computer hardware and software applications.
It manages hardware resources, provides an interface for applications to interact with the hardware, and ensures the efficient and stable operation of the computer system.

## Explain the concept of a network protocol.
A network protocol is a set of rules that governs the communication between devides on a network.
It defines how data is formatted, transmitted, and received, ensuring that devices can communicate effectively regardless of their underlying hardware or software.

## Explain the difference between a binary search and a linear search.
A linear search sequentially checks each element in an array until the target element is found.
A binary search, on the other hand, requires a sorted array and repeatedly divides the search interval in half.
Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), while linear search has a time complexity of O(n).

## What are the advantages of using a hash table?
Hash tables provide fast average-case lookup, insertion, and deletion operations with a time complexity of O(1).
They are efficient for implementing associative arrays, dictionaries, and caches.

## Explain the concept of a graph traversal algorithm.
A graph traversal algorithm systematically visits all the vertices in a graph.
Common graph traversal algorithms include depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). 
These algorithms are used in various applications, such as network routing, social network analysis, and web crawling.
